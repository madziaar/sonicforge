# SONIC FORGE V7.5: USER GUIDE

This guide provides a technical overview of the Sonic Forge terminal, updated for the **Suno v5** era. This is a high-performance, AI-augmented music engineering environment designed to interface with the new **Suno Studio** capabilities.

## 1. THE NEW REALITY: SUNO V5 & STUDIO

The landscape has changed. Suno is no longer just a generator; it is a **Generative DAW**. Sonic Forge V7.5 has been calibrated to match this professional workflow.

### Key Capabilities
-   **Studio Quality**: v5 models offer "mud-free" mixing and authentic, human-like vocals.
-   **8-Minute Architectures**: We can now blueprint full-length progressive journeys.
-   **12-Stem Extraction**: The neural core now thinks in stems (Vocals, Drums, Bass, Guitar, Piano, etc.).
-   **Licensed Training**: Fully compliant with the Warner Music Group partnership.

## 2. THE DUAL WORKFLOWS

### The Forge (`/forge`)
-   **Purpose**: Rapid prototyping and "Simple Mode" emulation with deep enhancement.
-   **Workflow**: Define Concept, Vibe, and Tech Anchors. The AI constructs the perfect prompt.
-   **New in V7.5**:
    -   **Inspire Logic**: (Coming Soon) Analyze playlist DNA.
    -   **V5 Fidelity**: Prompt enhancers now target "Studio Quality" and "True Stereo".

### The Studio (`/studio`)
-   **Purpose**: Granular sound design and DAW emulation.
-   **Workflow**: A rack-based interface for sculpting Vocal, Instrument, and Atmos layers.
-   **Key Features**:
    -   **Stem Matrix**: Control focus for 12 distinct stems (simulated in prompt weighting).
    -   **Sequencer**: Drag-and-drop structure builder supporting 8-minute timelines.
    -   **Lyrical Architect**: Advanced editor for v5-optimized lyrics (retains Pipe Syntax and Power Endings).

## 3. DEEP REASONING (THE AGENTIC CASCADE)

Sonic Forge uses a multi-agent system to ensure your prompts survive the v5 inference engine.

1.  **The Researcher**: Scours for specific hardware models (e.g., "Neve 1073 preamp") to trigger v5's training associations.
2.  **The Architect**: Plans the narrative arc and energy flow.
3.  **The Inquisitor**: Audits for "Prompt Drift" and conflicting descriptors.

## 4. NEURAL IDENTITIES (PERSONAS)

Select your **Producer Persona** to color the AI's creative output.

1.  **The Architect (Standard)**: Clinical adherence to v5 technical specs.
2.  **Pyrite (The Muse)**: "Fool's Gold" Protocol. Prioritizes Industrial/Glitch textures and sassy delivery.
3.  **Shin (The Coder)**: Optimizes for Technical Metal and DnB. Focuses on transient response and mix clarity.
4.  **Twin Flames**: High-contrast fusion.

## 5. ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

### V5 "Humanization"
To exploit v5's new vocal engine, use:
-   **Micro-descriptors**: "Breathy", "Fried", "Vibrato", "Close-mic".
-   **Performance Tags**: `[gasp]`, `[laugh]`, `[spoken: whispers]`.

### The Power Ending
Despite v5 improvements, we strictly enforce the **Termination Protocol**:
-   Always end lyrics with `[Outro][Instrumental Fade Out][End]` to prevent hallucinations.
