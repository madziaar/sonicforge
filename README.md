# 🎵 SONIC FORGE V5 // OBSIDIAN MASTERPIECE

An advanced music prompt engineering workstation designed for **Suno V4.5+**. Created for architects who demand high-fidelity control over their neural synthesis.

## 🚀 QUICKSTART

1.  **Environment Setup**: Create a `.env.local` file in the root.
    ```bash
    API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
    ```
2.  **Installation**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Development**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## 🛠️ ARCHITECTURE: THE OBSIDIAN PIPELINE

Sonic Forge uses a clinical multi-agent pipeline to ensure output fidelity:
- **Researcher Agent**: Scours Google Search for specific production gear, era-specific mixing techniques, and harmonic anchors.
- **Architect Agent**: Leverages `gemini-3-pro-preview` with a 32k thinking budget to plan song narrative arcs.
- **Critic Agent**: Audits every generated prompt for character limits and V4.5 syntax (pipe operators, melisma hyphens).
- **Refiner Agent**: Surgically repairs flaws detected during the audit phase.

## 🔄 AI STUDIO SYNC

This repository is designed to remain in absolute sync with the [Google AI Studio Workstation](https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1fqRRD9fxmJJpzXelJwtBksMeP71lejZa).

**To push local changes back:**
1.  Verify the integrity: `npm run type-check`
2.  Format the codebase: `npm run format`
3.  Open the AI Studio app → Click **Export** → Choose **Commit to Repository**.

## ⚖️ LEGAL & PERSONAS

Personas like **Pyrite**, **Shin**, and **Twin Flames** are fictional entities designed to provide stylistic creative biases. Engaging "Overclocked Mode" removes generation restrictions for unadulterated artistic intent.
