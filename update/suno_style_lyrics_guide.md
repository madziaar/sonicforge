## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Vowel Extension (Melodic Vocals)

**Creates longer, more melodious vocal lines**

**Syntax:** Extend vowel with hyphens
```
goodbye → goo-o-o-odbye
love → lo-o-o-ove
stay → sta-a-a-ay
free → fre-e-e-ee
```

**Example:**
```
[Chorus]
I'll ne-e-e-ever let you go-o-o-o
This lo-o-o-ove will always gro-o-o-ow
```

**Best for:**
- Choruses
- Emotional moments
- Sustained notes
- Pop/R&B vocals

### 2. Background Vocals (Parentheses)

**Adds backing vocals automatically**

**Syntax:** Put background text in parentheses
```
Main lyric (background response)
```

**Examples:**
```
E la cha-cha-cha (cha)
Feel the rhythm (feel it)
Can't stop dancing (dancing tonight)
Yeah yeah (oh yeah)
```

**Creates:**
- Call and response
- Vocal layers
- Depth and richness
- Choir effects

### 3. Chord Annotations

**Guides harmonic structure**

**Syntax:** Chord names in parentheses before words
```
(Em) Walking down the street
(G) Under city lights
(D) Searching for a sign
(C) Everything's alright
```

**Example Progression:**
```
[Verse 1]
(Am) The night is dark and cold
(F) Whispers in the air
(C) Shadows dance around
(G) In this place of despair
```

**Benefits:**
- Controls melody direction
- Guides harmonic choices
- More musical control
- Better for specific vibes

### 4. Musical Notation Per Syllable

**Extreme melodic control**

**Syntax:** Note name before each syllable
```
(G)Beat (G)of (A)the (B)heart (C)goes (D)on
```

**Example:**
```
[Chorus]
(C)Walk (D)ing (E)down (F)the (G)street (A)to (B)night (C)
```

**Use when:**
- Need exact melody
- Specific note progression
- Complex musical ideas
- Advanced productions

### 5. Inline Style Descriptions

**Section-specific styling**

**Syntax:**
```
(Section Name) [style description]:
Lyrics here
```

**Examples:**
```
(Chorus) [heavy riffs, driving beat, powerful vocals]:
We're unstoppable tonight
Fighting through the dark

(Verse 1) [soft synths, gentle vocals, minimal drums]:
Whispers in the morning light
Shadows slowly fade away

(Bridge) [stripped back, piano only, emotional delivery]:
And all we have is now
This moment here with you
```

**Benefits:**
- Fine-tune each section

City lights are fading fast
Running through the streets at last

Hear the distant siren call
Nothing here can hold us down
We own this sleeping town

Breaking through the dark
Burning way too bright
We'll leave our mark
Unstoppable tonight

Future's rushing way too fast
But we're moving with the flow
